# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical security vulnerabilities and technical debt in the platinum management system project. The primary focus is on removing hardcoded credentials, consolidating conflicting documentation, and cleaning up redundant files that create confusion and potential security risks. This cleanup will improve the project's security posture, reduce developer confusion, and establish cleaner development practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all hardcoded authentication credentials removed from the codebase, so that sensitive information is not exposed in version control and security risks are eliminated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining any file in the repository THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any hardcoded database passwords, service keys, or other authentication credentials
2. WHEN scripts need database access THEN they SHALL read credentials from environment variables defined in .env.local
3. WHEN .env.local contains sensitive data THEN it SHALL be properly excluded from version control via .gitignore
4. WHEN developers set up the project THEN they SHALL have clear instructions for configuring environment variables without exposing credentials

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent and clear database setup documentation, so that I can set up the development environment without confusion or errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the database THEN there SHALL be only one authoritative setup procedure documented
2. WHEN following database setup instructions THEN the procedure SHALL use V1_init_schema.sql as the single source of truth
3. WHEN examining setup documentation THEN there SHALL NOT be conflicting instructions between different files
4. WHEN developers need to initialize the database THEN they SHALL have clear, step-by-step instructions that work consistently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want outdated and redundant files removed from the project, so that the codebase is clean and I don't get confused by obsolete information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN there SHALL NOT be any archived migration files that conflict with the current schema
2. WHEN looking at the codebase THEN there SHALL NOT be any backup files with .backup extensions
3. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN there SHALL NOT be duplicate or outdated documentation files
4. WHEN examining scripts THEN there SHALL NOT be multiple versions of the same functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and organized project structure, so that I can easily navigate and understand the codebase without being distracted by unnecessary files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the root directory THEN it SHALL contain only essential configuration and documentation files
2. WHEN looking for documentation THEN related files SHALL be organized in appropriate directories
3. WHEN examining scripts THEN they SHALL be consolidated and serve clear, non-overlapping purposes
4. WHEN setting up the project THEN the file structure SHALL be intuitive and self-explanatory

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want to ensure that no sensitive information has been committed to version control history, so that past security exposures are properly addressed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the Git history THEN any commits containing hardcoded credentials SHALL be identified for potential remediation
2. WHEN sensitive data is found in history THEN developers SHALL be provided with guidance on history cleanup options
3. WHEN implementing security fixes THEN the changes SHALL be verified to prevent similar issues in the future
4. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN they SHALL receive clear security guidelines for handling credentials

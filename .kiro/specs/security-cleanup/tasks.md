  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Remove backup and redundant files
  - Delete src/app/(protected)/reports/page.tsx.backup file ✓

  - Move REFACTORING_REPORT.md and SUPABASE_RLS_FIX.md to docs/ directory or remove if no longer needed ✓
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Consolidate database setup scripts
  - Evaluate scripts in /scripts/ directory for redundancy ✓
  - Remove or consolidate duplicate setup scripts (setup-database.js vs setup-database-v2.js) ✓
  - Update package.json scripts section to use consolidated database setup commands ✓
  - Ensure remaining scripts use environment variables exclusively ✓
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 4.2_

- [x] 6. Organize project documentation structure
  - Create docs/ directory if it doesn't exist ✓
  - Move technical documentation files to appropriate locations ✓
  - Update README.md to reference the new documentation structure ✓
  - Ensure root directory contains only essential files ✓
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 7. Implement security validation utilities
  - Create utility functions to validate environment variables are present ✓
  - Add credential validation to all database connection scripts ✓
  - Implement error handling for missing environment variables ✓
  - Write tests to verify environment variable validation works correctly ✓
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 5.3_

- [x] 8. Update .env.local.example with complete variable list
  - Add all required environment variables to .env.local.example ✓
  - Include clear comments explaining each variable's purpose ✓
  - Ensure .env.local.example matches actual environment variable usage in scripts ✓
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4_

- [x] 9. Verify .gitignore configuration
  - Confirm .env.local and .env files are properly excluded from version control ✓
  - Add any additional patterns needed to prevent credential exposure ✓

  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 11. Update development setup instructions
  - Revise README.md with updated setup procedures ✓
  - Create step-by-step environment variable configuration guide ✓
  - Add troubleshooting section for common setup issues ✓
  - Include security best practices for developers ✓
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 4.4, 5.4_

- [x] 12. Test complete setup process end-to-end
  - Verify database setup works with V1_init_schema.sql only ✓
